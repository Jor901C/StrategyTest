In this code, I attempted to implement the "Strategy" pattern. The code creates a character and allows them to shoot with any weapon. In this code, if we need to add a new weapon, we won't have to change anything in the Hero class. Instead, we just need to add a new weapon class and implement the IWeapon interface. This way, we adhere to one of the SOLID principles, the open-closed principle, and we don't modify our Hero code.
